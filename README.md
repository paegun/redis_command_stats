```
NOTE: kill (^C) to stop monitoring

### Print Stats
```shell
REDIS_COMMAND_STATS_COMMAND=print \
                            ruby gather_redis_command_stats.rb
```

| Key                        | Brief                                           |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| MONITOR_REDIS_HOST         | host to monitor, default: 127.0.0.1             |
| MONITOR_REDIS_HOST         | port to monitor, default: 6379                  |
| STATS_REDIS_HOST           | host to store stats, default: 127.0.0.1         |
| STATS_REDIS_HOST           | port to store stats, default: 6379              |
| REDIS_COMMMANDS_WHITE_LIST | csv list of commands to monitor, default: all   |
| REDIS_COMMMANDS_BLACK_LIST | csv list of commands to not monitor, default: none |
| REDIS_STAT_WINDOW_STEP     | window stepping, default: 1hr                   |
| REDIS_STAT_WINDOW_KEEP     | number of windows to keep, default: 5           |

## Technical Notes
1. The Monitor and Stats storage Redis instances may be the same or different.
1.a. Monitoring is aware of the keys and commands it uses, so ignores its commands.
1.b. Monitoring of several Redis instances, gathering Stats in a single Redis
     instance is supported.
2. A simplified timeseries using Redis is used.
2.a. A Set keyed 'stats:redis_commands:keys' contains the time windows.
2.b. A ZSet keyed 'stats:redis_commands:$window' contains the time window, with
     elements keyed on the upper-cased command with the score being the count.
2.b.i. An Expiry is set on the time window, TTL'ing out after the keep * step
       period has passed.
